## v0.1.0

* Initial release

## v0.1.1.beta

Added 2 new methods:

* drop_down_divider
* drop_down_header

These allow you to add dividers and headers into your dropdowns. Surprisingly enough...

## v0.1.2.beta

* Allow options for menu_items to pass through to link_to, so that you can set IDs, classes, method, data-tags etc.

## v0.1.3.beta

* Made the menu_text feature work properly (it was missing a css class). Also added the ability to pull it left or right.

## v0.1.4.beta

* Added ability to change the link for the brand text

## v0.1.5.beta

* Minor fix - make menu_item link default to "#"
* Readme updates
